👾 Hi there! My name is Karen Le, I am a creative and enthusiatic Software Engineer!👾 

👩‍💻 I love making new friends as well as creating new projects. I love thinking of new ways to make coding more exciting! 
When passionate and devoted, I am a fast learner. 👩‍💻

Aside from drinking coffee until I shake all day, I also enjoy planting and playing video games! Another hobby I have is documenting projects I create, 
(something about documenting how a project turns out is extremely exciting to me!)

If you enjoy creating new projects and experiences, feel free to contact me! I'd love to meet you!
